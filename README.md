# Paths
###Paths is a mini widget that runs in your mac's menu bar to navigate your Finder's/File system's hierarchy. 

###\*\*\* The motivation behined this mini project is that I was frustrated having to switch windows, when in full screen, to drag files to my code editors and having to do multiple clicks before getting the paths to my files. \*\*\*

###Paths allows you to navigate your finders's/file System's hierarchy, drag and drop files to your apps or editors, as well as viewing and copying the paths to your files, and seeing their extensions.

# Paths
###Paths is a mini widget that runs in your Mac's menu bar to view your finder's hierarchy. 

###\*\*\* The motivation behined this mini project is that I was frustrated having to switch windows, when in full screen, to drag files to my code editors and having to do multiple clicks before getting the path to my files. \*\*\*
